# Windows 10 IoT Core Pi Servo Dancer
========

A demo showing how to get two servos to move to a beat using a Raspberry Pi and Windows 10 IoT Core.

If you make something cool from this code using Windows 10 IoT Core and the Raspberry Pi, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.
